    <h2><strong>My Ultimate Goal</strong></h2>
    <p>Coding is a subject that I always have dabbled in, but never really sat down and really put much effort into.
       It has always been something I have been interested in, ever since the days of <em>MySpace</em> when I learned you could edit your page's html code.
       I spent countless hours changing around my page's layout and trying to make it the coolest page any 16 year old had ever seen.
       Needless to say, all of them were rather cringy and actually not that impressive. But it was my first experience with any sort of coding.</p>
    <p>When I went back to college I decided to go for a degree in Cyber Security. Unfortunately, just an associates in the field doesn't get you very far.
       The classes were ultimatly boring, and didn't teach any hand's on. Instead they revolved around teaching us the practices and ethics of the field, which doesn't help much if you still don't know how to do anything besides crimp an ethernet cable.
       Many of the days I spent in those classes led to me sitting on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> messing around with various languages. And I learned the basics of many laguages, including java, html, python, and various C languages.
       However, it was something I never really followed up on outside of school.</p>
    <p>After I lost my job as a tech support agent I spent many weeks looking for jobs before coming across an ad for a free 2 hour coding class. After attending the class I began to look into different boot camps around the Denver area which led me to discover Skill Distillery.
       I applied and went through the interview process and was ecstatic when I was accepted. I began to do some of the prework, and very quickly I discovered that this was what I had been looking for for so long. Coding was my calling.
       I loved doing the work and learning more and more. And I cannot wait until the course starts and I am able to learn how to do even more with the Java language, as well as learn other languages. </p>
    <p>This leads me to my ultimate goal with coming out of the boot camp. I am an avid gamer, and would love to learn how to, and also design a game for Android devices. I think it would be very fun to design apps, and not just apps that are games, but all kinds.
       I also find the process of creating a website fun and wouldn't mind doing something in that field as well. Ultimatly, I think that as long as I am creating things, I will be enjoying what I do.</P>
