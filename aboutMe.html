      <h2>About Andrew Lyon</h2>
      <p>Hello, and thank you for taking interest in my journey.  I am happy that you are here so that we can experience together.</p>
      <p>My name is Andrew Lyon. I am 29 years old, and live in Denver, CO. I am an avid computer gamer, board game enthusiast, begginer skiier, hiker, and aspiring programmer. I love pizza, chicken fingers, and a good ol' beer (recommendations greatly appreciated) I am a huge nerd. Comic book nerd, video game nerd, board game nerd, and hopefully soon a programming nerd. I currently have a Bachelor's degree in History from SUNY New Paltz and an Associate's degree in Cyber Security from SUNY Orange.</p>
      <p>I recently found myself without a job. After spending a few weeks looking for a new one, I happened across coding boot camps. I looked into them and decided this was what I needed to do with my life. I have always enjoyed coding.. well, the small amount that I new at least. But now I will hopefully be able to make a career out of it. After spending some time looking into different options, I decided upon Skill Distillery's Java Boot Camp. I applied and soon after I was accpeted into the program! This blog will be detailing my time at Skill Distillery, and showcasing the knoweldge I gain from the boot camp. I have little experience in the topic right now, but am looking forward to learning something knew, as well as sharing my experience as it unfolds. I will (hopefully) be updating this blog a few times a week with my stories, experiences, and new projects. This is an exciting time for me, and I am very grateful to have the chance to take part in Skill Distillery's Java Boot Camp.</p>
      <p>Thank you again for stopping by. I hope you decide to stay :)</p>
